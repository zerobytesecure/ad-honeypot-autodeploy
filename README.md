# ad-honeypot-autodeploy

Deploy a small, intentionally insecure, vulnerable Windows Domain
for RDP Honeypot fully automatically.

Runs on self-hosted virtualization using [libvirt](https://libvirt.org)
with [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/)/[KVM](https://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page) (but it can be customized easily for cloud-based solutions).

Used for painlessly set up a small Windows Domain from scratch
automatically (without user interaction) for the purpose of RDP Honeypot
testing.

Features a Domain Controller, a Desktop Computer and a configured
Graylog server for logging the actions of the bad guys.

## Automatic deployment phases

1. [Packer](https://www.packer.io/): download the necessary install media and setup the
automated base virtual machine images unattended.

2. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/): provision the libvirt virtualization infrastructure
(network + virtual machines) using the packer-prepared
virtual machine images.

3. [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/): Configure the infrastructure (DC, Desktop, Graylog)
automatically, without user interaction.

After going through the Packer+Terraform+Ansible pipeline,
the configured Windows Domain should be up and running, you could
attach the RDP service of the Desktop to the public internet, and
let's monitor the events through the Graylog.

## Features

Features of the running system are:

* a Windows Server 2016 as a Domain Controller
* a Windows 10 Desktop (version 21H2) as a Domain Computer
* a [Graylog](https://www.graylog.org/) 3.3 (Open Source edition) running as a Log Collector on [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) 18.04 LTS
* Using [VirtIO](https://wiki.libvirt.org/page/Virtio) drivers for best performance
* Enabled RDP and WinRM Services
* Populated Windows Active Directory with random users
* [Sysmon](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon) (from [Windows Sysinternals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/)) installed and running on Domain Computers
* [NXLog](https://nxlog.co/) Collector running a Domain Computers and forwarding logs to Graylog
* Configured Graylog GeoIP lookup table and pipeline for IP addresses (useful for showing a map of invalid RDP login attempts)
* Graylog World Map of RDP attacks
* an extra [Kali](https://www.kali.org/) VM attached to the Windows subnet for playing with attack techniques

## Host System Requirements

Virtualization needs some power of your host system:

* ~100 GB disk space for the base images and the sparse images of the guest computers.
* at least 4 x 4 GB memory for the guest machines
(may run with less than 16 GB because of overcommitment)
* installed up-to-date libvirt with QEMU/KVM (official current packages in Ubuntu 18.04 LTS should work)
* Python 3 (preferably with venv) for Ansible

Tested on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS host.

## Installation and Usage

First, clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/tothi/ad-honeypot-autodeploy
cd ad-honeypot-autodeploy
```

Before starting with Packer, set up the intial passwords (watch for complexity requirements):

```
./init_passwords.sh
```

### Packer

Now build the initial images.

```
cd packer
```

Windows Server 2016 and Ubuntu installation media should be downloaded
by the Packer script. VirtIO needs to be downloaded by the attached
get-virtio.sh script:

```
./get-virtio.sh
```

Windows 10 should be downloaded manually by getting a temporary
download link and save it to the ISO folder. The download link
could be obtained from [here](https://www.microsoft.com/hu-hu/software-download/windows10ISO). Select the English (International), 64-bit version and
save the ISO to `ISO/Win10_21H2_EnglishInternational_x64.iso`.

For mapping IP locations on a World Map in Graylog, the MaxMind GeoIP
database is needed. Unfortunately due to licensing terms it cannot
be redistributed, so you have to download it manually (after registering)
from the [MaxMind site](https://www.maxmind.com). The free GeoLite2 version should work, get the
"GeoLite2 City" Database in MMDB format (download the GZIP and untar)
and put it at `resources/GeoLite2-City.mmdb`.

If you do not have Packer, get the latest version from the packer.io site
([download the pre-compiled binary](https://www.packer.io/downloads.html))
or try to [add the Hashicorp repository](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli) to your packaging system (useful for Terrafrom also).

If you are rebuilding the images, do not forget to clean up previous
builds:

```
rm -fr output_*
```

If you want to re-download the images, remove packer_cache:

```
rm -fr packer_cache
```

After these preparing steps, run the Packer builds in parallel:

```
./packer-build-all.sh
```

![Packer in action](./packer.png)

The images should be ready in a reasonable time (~20-30 mins depending
on your host hardware power).

### Terraform

Now the infrastructure can be deployed using Terraform.

Get Terraform (>=0.13) if you do not have it (look at the install methods
at Packer, above).

[Terraform provider for libvirt](https://github.com/dmacvicar/terraform-provider-libvirt)
should be automatically downloaded from the [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/)
during the apply phase.

Enter Terraform folder:

```
cd ../terraform
```

Initialize the working directory (only needed for first time use):
```
terraform init
```

Build and launch the infrastructure ("apply the changes"):
```
terraform apply
```

Note, that if the user running `terraform apply` is not root, sudo privileges for running `/usr/sbin/iptables`
is needed (without password).

![Terraform in action](./terraform.png)

After a short time (~2-3 mins),
the network and virtual machines are up and running. If there are any failures, `terraform destroy` might not be enough,
manual undefining resources may be necessary.

> WARNING: You should take care of protecting your private
> network. The terraform config (main.tf) provided here just contains
> a custom firewall rule for my own testing environment
> (blocking 192.168.0.0/16 destination traffic from the
> 192.168.3.0/24 honeypot network).

Next is the configuration phase.

### Ansible

Get into the ansible folder:

```
cd ../ansible
```

Recommended installation method is installing the latest Ansible
with some required additional dependencies in a Python venv virtualized
environment:
```
python3 -m venv venv
. ./venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

For later use just activate the venv by
```
. ./venv/bin/activate
```

And just `deactivate` if it is not needed anymore in your
current session.

You should put an SSH public key with filename `id.pub` (use `ssh-keygen`) into the ansible
folder for accessing the Ubuntu Graylog machine with the ubuntu user
(ansible will add it to `~ubuntu/.ssh/authorized_keys`).

The `wordlist.txt` file contains some (intentionally weak) passwords
for the populated domain users which can be customized.

Run the configuration phase:

```
ansible-playbook -i hosts setup-domain.yml -v
```

![Ansible in action](./ansible.png)

After 20-25 mins everything is ready.

## The deployed system

| hostname  | ip address    | operating system          | role                      |
| --------- | ------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| dc1       | 192.168.3.100 | Windows Server 2016       | Domain Controller         |
| desktop12 | 192.168.3.112 | Windows 10 (version 2004) | Domain Member Workstation |
| graylog   | 192.168.3.191 | Ubuntu 18.04 LTS          | Graylog Server            |
| kali      | 192.168.3.192 | Kali Rolling (2022.3)     | Offensive Operations      |

According to the libvirt network configuration (NAT), the hosts can access
the public internet (if your host system allows it).

Accessing the hosts is possible through the host system.
Practically using an SSH socks tunnel and proxychains for RDP or WinRM
access is very comfortable.

For example, if your libvirt host IP is 192.168.0.10,
create a socks tunnel listening on `localhost:5000` by
```
ssh 192.168.0.10 -D5000 -NTv
```

And access the Windows 10 desktop (using an appropriate `/etc/proxychains.conf`
configured for the :5000 tunnel):
```
proxychains xfreerdp /v:192.168.3.112 /u:administrator
```

Or, access the Graylog web interface listening on :9000 locally on
the Graylog Ubuntu server by SSH ProxyJump and custom forward tunnel:
```
ssh -J 192.168.0.10 ubuntu@192.168.3.191 -NTv -L9000:127.0.0.1:9000
```

Then open URL `http://localhost:9000` and you reach the Graylog web
interface.

For activating the RDP honeypot, just allow public access
to 192.168.3.112:3389 (for example with some port forwarding
configuration on your router and iptables rules on the host
machine; my helper script is [rdp_public.sh](ansible/rdp_public.sh))
and keep watching the Graylog. ;)
